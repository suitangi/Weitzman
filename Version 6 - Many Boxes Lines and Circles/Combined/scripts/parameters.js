  question: "<strong>In the following game, we would like for you to consider the following situation:</strong><br>You are standing in front of 5 boxes. You know that each box contains a prize, but you don’t know what that prize is. The higher the number of the prize the more valuable it is to you. You do not know the exact value of the prize in the box, but each box has a label on it that tells you your chance of winning prizes of different values.<br><br>For example, a box might have a label that says that it contains a prize worth some value from 1 through 100. This means there is one number in the box that could be any value from 1 to 100. If you open that box, you may keep that value or open another box to see if it contains a higher value.<br><br><strong>Here’s how the game works:</strong><br>On each round, you can open one or more of the boxes, one at a time. In addition to being labeled with possible prize values, each box is also labeled with a cost. Each time you open a box, you pay the cost that is on the box. For example, if the box has a cost of 5, you will pay 5 points to open that box.<br><br>On each round, <u>you must open one or more boxes</u>. At the end of a round, you will win the largest prize that you found minus the total amount you paid to open boxes.<br><br>Each round will last 20 seconds. Once you open all the boxes that you want to open in that round, you should <u>wait until the timer for that round runs out without opening any additional boxes</u><br><br>For example, if you open 2 boxes. It cost you 3 points to open the first box and you found a prize of 50. It cost you 7 points to open a second box and you found a prize of 45. Your winnings for that rounds are 40. That is 50 (the larger of your two numbers 45 and 50) minus 10 (the sum of the costs of opening the two boxes = 3 + 7).<br><br>Finally, your bonus will be 0.5% of your winnings from one randomly selected round. For example, if you won 40 points, you would receive a bonus of 20 cents (0.20 USD).<u>If you do not open one or more boxes in all rounds, you will not receive a bonus.</u><br><br>We will now be asking you 6 questions about the task.

  question: "<strong>We would like for you to consider the following shopping situation:</strong><br><br>You are interested in watching a movie. There are some movies that you are considering watching. All of them seem like movies you might enjoy. For each movie, you can spend a few minutes learning about the movie (for example by watching a trailer, reading plot synopses, or reading specific reviews). By doing this, you can get a clear sense for how much you will like the movie.  Before you spend time to learn about the movie, you know the ratings that other people who have watched the movie have given it. These ratings are a good source of information about how much you might like the movie. Then if you choose to learn more about the movie you will get an much more precise idea about how much you will like it.<br><br>Other people have rated each of the movies on a 200 point scale where 0 means that a movie is the worst that the person has ever seen and 200 means that it is the best. These user ratings for each movie are presented using a picture like the one below:<br><img src=\"./img/sc5.png\"><br>In the example above, you can see that on the scale from 0 to 200, other people rated the movie as between roughly 75 points and 180 points.<br><br><strong>Here’s how the movie search works:</strong><br>In each round, we are going to give you a chance to learn about several movies. For each movie, we will give you ratings from other people who already viewed the movie, like those shown in the box above. You can learn more about how much you personally might like the movie by clicking on these graphs, one at a time. Once you click on a graph, you will see how much you like the movie after learning more about it on a scale from 0 to 200. Other people’s rating give you a good idea about how much you will like the movie.  Your personal “score” for the movie is always “inside” the range of ratings made by the other people.<br><br>You can end a round any time after you learn more about at least one movie (by clicking on at least one graph). To end a round, simply wait until the timer runs out <strong><em>without</em></strong> learning about any other movies.<br><br>When you end a round, you will be rewarded points based on the <strong><em>highest rating</em></strong> you found among the movies that you learned about and the <strong><em>number</strong></em> of movies you learned about.<strong>Your points for the round will be the value of the highest rated movie among those that you clicked on to learn about <u>minus</u> 1 points for each movie you learned more about</strong>. You can think of the 1 points it costs to learn about each movie as the effort and time that it takes you to learn about a movie. You can think of the value of the movie as indicating how much you would like that movie if you ended up watching it.<br><br>For example, if you learn about 2 movies and are told that they are worth 20 points and 70 points, your winnings for the round will be 68 points. That is 70 (70 points for the highest movie car you found) minus 2 (because you learned about 2 movies at a cost of 1 points each)<br><br>Finally, your bonus will be 1% of your winnings from one randomly selected round. For example, if you won 68 points, you would receive a bonus of 68 cents (0.68 USD). <strong>Please note that you MUST click on at least one movie in each round. If you fail to learn about at least one movie in all rounds, you will not receive a bonus.</strong><br><br>We will now be asking you 7 questions about the task.
