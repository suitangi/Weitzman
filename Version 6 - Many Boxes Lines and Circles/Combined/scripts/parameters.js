	question: "<strong>We would like for you to consider the following situation:</strong><br><br>You are interested in watching a movie. There are some movies that you are considering watching. All of them seem like movies you might enjoy. For each movie, you can spend a few minutes learning about the movie (for example by watching a trailer, reading plot synopses, or reading specific reviews). By doing this, you can get a clear sense for how much you will like the movie. Before you spend time to learn about the movie, you know the ratings that other people who have watched the movie have given it. These ratings are a good source of information about how much you might like the movie. Then if you choose to learn more about the movie you will get a much more precise idea about how much you will like it.<br><br>Other people have rated each of the movies on a 200 point scale where 0 means that a movie is the worst that the person has ever seen and 200 means that it is the best. <br><br> We will provide you with the best and the worst rating that other viewers have given the movies. These ratings will be presented to you like this:<br> <img src=\"./img/sc5_numerical.png\"><br> For the movie above, the person who liked it least rated it 75 while the person who liked it the most rated it 180. <br><br> You should assume that your own rating of this movie, once you learn more about it, has an equal chance of falling anywhere between these two numbers (including these numbers). For example, once you learn more about the movie, you have an equal chance of liking it 75, 123, 144, 180, or any other amount between 75 and 180.<br><br> You may assume that you will not like the movie any more than the person who has liked it best and will not dislike it any more than the person who liked it least.<br><br> <strong>Here’s how the movie search works:</strong><br><br>In each round, we are going to give you a chance to learn about several movies. For each movie, we will give you a box that contains ratings from other people who already viewed the movie, like those shown in the box above. You can learn more about how much you personally might like the movie by clicking on the boxes that tell you about the ratings, one at a time.<br><br>Once you click on a box, you will see how much you like the movie after learning more about it on a scale from 0 to 200. Other people’s rating give you a good idea about how much you will like the movie. Your personal “score” for the movie is always “inside” the range of ratings made by the other people. <br><br>You can end a search any time after you learn more about at least one movie (by clicking on at least box). To end a round, simply wait until the timer runs out <em><strong>without </strong></em>learning about any other movies. <br><br>When you end a search, you will be rewarded points based on the <em><strong>highest rating</em></strong> you found among the movies that you learned about and the <em><strong>number</em></strong> of movies you learned about. <strong>Your points for the round will be the value of the highest rated movie among those that you clicked on to learn about <u>minus</u> 1 points for each movie you learned more about.</strong> You can think of the 1 point it costs to learn about each movie as the effort and time that it takes you to learn about a movie. You can think of the value of the movie as indicating how much you would like that movie if you ended up watching it.<br><br>For example, if you learn about 2 movies and are told that they are worth 20 points and 70 points, your winnings for the round will be 68 points.
