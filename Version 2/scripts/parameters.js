    question: "<strong>In the following game, we would like for you to consider the following shopping situation:</strong><br><br>You are shopping for a new car. There are five cars that you are considering that all cost the same. For each car, you can drive an hour to a dealership and test drive the car to get a sense for how you like the car. You don’t know how much you are going to like a car until you test drive it, but you do know the ratings that other people have given the car.<br><br>People have rated each of the cars on a 200 point scale, where 0 means that a car is the worse that the person has ever driven and 200 means that it is the best. These user ratings for each car are presented using a graphic like the one below:<br><img src=\"./img/sc5.png\"><br>In the example above, you can see that on the scale from 0 to 200, all ratings fall between roughly 30 points and 100 points.<br><br><strong>Here’s how the game works:</strong><br>In each round, we are going to have you look at up to 5 cars. For each car, we will give you ratings like those shown in the box above. You can test drive one or more of the cars by clicking on these graphs, one at a time. Once you click on a graph, you will see how much you like the car after test driving it on a scale from 0 to 200.<br><br>You can end a round after you test drive at least one car. To end a round, simply wait until the timer runs out <em><strong>without</strong></em> test driving any of the other cars.<br><br>When you end a round, you will be rewarded points based on the highest rating you found after test driving a car and the number of test drives that you did. <strong>Your points for the round will be the value of the highest rated car among your those that you took for a test drive <u>minus</u> 5 points for each car that you took for a test drive</strong>. You can think of the 5 points it costs to test drive each car as the effort, time, and money that it takes you to drive an hour to the dealership and test drive a car. You can think of the value of the car as indicating how much you would like that car if you ended up buying the car for your own use.<br><br>For example, if you test drive 2 cars and are told that they are worth 20 points and 70 points, your winnings for the round will be 60 points. That is 70 (70 points for the highest value car you found) minus 10 (remember you took 2 cars for a test drive at a cost of 5 points each)<br><br>Finally, your bonus will be 0.5% of your winnings from one randomly selected round. For example, if you won 50 points, you would receive a bonus of 25 cents (0.25 USD). <strong>Please note that you MUST test drive at least one car in each round. If you fail to test drive at least one car in all rounds, you will not receive a bonus.</strong><br><br>We will now be asking you 5 questions about the task.
