# Condition Numbering 

### This version contains two identical conditions featuring a separate timer for each condition, timer 1 and timer 2, respectively. The version also features two separate instruction text parameters, instructionText1 and instructionText2, as well as a setting that allows limiting the number of clicks per condition, clickOnce1 and clickOnce2, respectively. The conditions are numbered as follows: 

#### 1.Graphical, Linear with Timer 1 (e.g. 20 Seconds)
#### 2.Graphical, Linear with Timer 2 (e.g. 5 Seconds)

### The numbering corresponds to the numbering on the index-{condition}.html file, meaning index-1.html will trigger condition 1 and index-2.html will trigger condition 2.
